# vector

vector is a single header **without** external dependencies, giving you the possibility to create dynamic vectors for every data type or struct you want :D

It is written in macros and is pretty straight forward to use!

See [test.c](https://github.com/0x3alex/vector/blob/main/test.c) for some usage examples.
